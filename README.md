# Image_Classifiaction_CIFAR10
This repository demonstrates image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, cats). The project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras to classify these images.
